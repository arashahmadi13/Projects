We also want to optimize our resume to better fit the market by finding skills that are in job postings but not in our resume.\n\nA high-level overview of the project goals and steps is:\n\nCollect HTML job postings and extract relevant sections for the next steps (primarily the HTML body and skill requirements â€“ you should find where the skill requirements are from looking at some HTML pages).\nFind which jobs are most similar to our resume based on the full text of our resume and full texts of the job posts. Future steps in the project will use this group of most similar job postings.\nUnderstand the major themes of job postings via the skill requirements of groups of jobs.\nFind which skills our resume is missing compared with what organizations are looking for (e.g., the skill requirements from job postings).","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# import libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n%matplotlib inline\n\nimport sklearn\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score,GridSearchCV\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler,LabelEncoder\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier,export_graphviz\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier\nfrom sklearn import linear_model\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression,Perceptron,SGDClassifier\nfrom sklearn.metrics import f1_score,accuracy_score,recall_score,classification_report,make_scorer,roc_curve, auc\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\nfrom sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB\n\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
